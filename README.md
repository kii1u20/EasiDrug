# EasiDrug

The purpose of this project was to provide a new market solution to the struggle of adherence and compliance with pill-taking that many face. This difficulty with pill-taking results in substantial financial loss for public health services, both through wasted medication and health complications arising from improper application of prescription medications. The currently available market solutions already cater to adult and elderly demographics, and thus this project aims to differentiate itself by also appealing to younger demographics through gamification. This project aimed to and succeeded in designing and developing a prototype for the EasiDrug product consisting of both a physical smart pillbox and a companion phone application. In tandem, these allow a user to schedule their medication, and receive reminders for when it should be taken through audio-visual means and notifications. Additionally, their use of the pillbox is logged and stored as to be able to be reviewed, particularly by caretakers and medical professionals, should the need arise. Gamification through points and achievements, extrinsic goals, motivates users to adhere to their schedules and solidify their routines. Ultimately, EasiDrug aids users in improving not only their health, but also their independence by reminding them of when their pills should be taken.
